# DATALab_toolbox

Free open source toolbox for analysis of multivariate experimental data based on methods widespread in Chemometrics. The toolbox can work with conventional two-way datasets (where rows are objects or measurements and columns are variables) as well as with colour and hyperspectral images. Currently only command line tools are available
